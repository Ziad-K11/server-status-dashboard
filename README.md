This Web-Application is used to emulate the looks of a Server-Runtime-Dashboard, data shown are entirely fictional and do not represent any real-time/real-world values and acts sorley as an emulator of the real thing. 

The application is simple the user is loaded to the main page which is the sign in, if it's the first time loading the app then it's better to click on the signup button to add an Email and password to be able to use to sign in. 

when the user finished signing up the data is stored in a .json file to use again later, then redircted to the sign in page again to use the credentials to be able to access the dashboard view.

once in the dashboard view the user can see the information about the available servers which are static information and hard-coded in the source code.

the user can also log-out from the button visible in the header, this button is only visible when the dashboard page is open, the button then redirects the user back to the main page i.e the sign in page.
no user sessions nor cookies are sed as this is a simple application used to show my take on a simple server status dashboard
